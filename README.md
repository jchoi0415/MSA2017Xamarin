# MSA2017Xamarin

This is my repository for the Module 2 Xamarin application for the Microsoft Student Accelerator programme.
I have built an emotion tracking application where the person takes a photo of him/herself and let the Microsoft Cognitive API (Emotion) analyse the user's emotion.
Then the app will store your emotion into the database using Easy Tables in Azure and you will be able to see how many times you had a specific emotion (Angry = 2, Happy = 5, Sad = 1 etc.)
