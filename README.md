# MSA2017Xamarin

This is my repository for the Module 2 Xamarin application for the Microsoft Student Accelerator programme.
I have built an emotion tracking application where the person takes a photo of him/herself and let the Microsoft Cognitive API (Emotion) analyse the user's emotion.
Then the app will store your emotion into the database using Easy Tables in Microsoft Azure.
